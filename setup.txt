bitboy setup
------------

I did not include any IDE files. So you have to connect and setup the compiler manually.

project bitboy
Creates a swc to be included in your main project to run and communicate with the worker.

project bitboy-shared
A shared library (swc) for bitboy and bitboy-worker.

project bitboy-worker
Should be compiled as a swf, where BitboyWorker is the entry class.
